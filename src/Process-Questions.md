TodoListPage - help with handleSubmit and .post, .set calls.  Check on how I'm setting state inside that handleSubmit, too.

Unsure about the handleSubmit and .put syntax to set tast to completed=true

Login.js- help in getting user token from back end, or it in state at this point?  I feel like it's in state but I'm a little unsure as backend token doesn't gave an endpoint to fetch from and we're setting it into state in render...
